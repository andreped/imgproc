'''
A set of functions relevant for 3D lung nodules segmentation. Two main functions: level_set3D and region_growing3D,
which both can take same CT-image stack, but only one seed-point, since it was of interest at the time. Also includes 
two 3D-kernels, which might come of interest if doing 3D-morphology. I would also recommend using the PYMRT-module, 
since it contains TONS of 2D and 3D-kernels. Also skimage should have a few 3D-kernels, but lacks a spheroid/ellipsoid
kernel, which was of interest at the time.
NB: Handle with caution. Default settings should hopefully rarely be changed, unless you are studying for instance
really tiny nodules, want a more specific fit for a single nodule, or if smoothing is to strong etc...

# --- INPUT ---
# data   : 3D CT-image stack, with assumed dimensions (z,y,x)
# seed3D : single 3D seed point corresponding to image dimensions
# resol  : list containing resolution info about CT-stack (z,x), assumed same res in x and y
# lambda1 : variance stabilizing coefficient. 
# lambda2 : second variance stabilizing coefficient. lambda1 and lambda2 defines ideal segmentation result
# smoothing : number of smoothing steps for each iteration
# iterations : number of iterations
# rad : radius for initial curve/surface. Defines the initial sphere from seed point
# method : method of level set used
# alpha : how steep the edges for the pre-processing step of GAC should be (isn't used in ACWE, only GAC)
# sigma : the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel -> smoothing coefficient (isn't used in ACWE, only GAC)
# balloon : defines the balloon force. 1 -> grows, -1 : shrinks (isn't used in ACWE, only GAC)
# --- OUTPUT ---
# new_res : result of 3D segmentation from single seed point
